        <div id="paragraph"><p><span class="highlight">In Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson, a few recurring Social Justice and Human Rights themes are Criminal Justice, Child Rights, Racial justice, and Poverty. Out of these 4 main themes, Criminal Justice is the most prominent as the book is about a lawyer who helps wrongly accused criminals on death row. The book talks about how criminals are mistreated and how they have to survive in substandard conditions in which some prisoners don't make it. Bryan Stevenson talks about how criminals are still people and don’t deserve to be executed just because they did something wrong. Racial Justice is also a large theme in the book as it takes place during the Civil Rights movement era when racism was at its peak. It talks about how black people make up the majority of the inmate population as they are significantly more likely to be accused of a crime or dealt with more severe charges due to the fact that people assume they are involved in a gang. This is due to the stereotype people back then had for blacks and latinos which was a violent man involved in gangs which we now know is not true. Penultimately, Child Rights play a key role in Just Mercy because back then the likelihood to obtain a life sentence for a crime committed as a teenager or child was far higher than it is now which is why quite a few of the cases in the book were about children. Finally, poverty is a major theme because the majority of if not all of the criminals were poor or homeless. This shows us that poor and homeless people are more likely to be accused as they are less favored by the government and can’t afford lawyers therefore they rely on non-profits like Bryan’s for legal protection. In summary, Criminal justice, Child rights, Racial Justice, and Poverty are all present in the novel due to the time these accusations were happening.</span></p></div>
