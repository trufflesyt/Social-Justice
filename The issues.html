        <div id="paragraph"><p><span class="highlight">Just Mercy deals with a variety of Social Justice issues including racism, rape, gang violence, drug abuse, injustice towards inmates, poverty, mental illnesses, sexual abuse, and  wrong accusations. An example of a Human rights violation in Just Mercy is Charlie who got put into solitary confinement at only 14 years old for shooting his mother’s abusive boyfriend George who excessively abused her. George made Charlie’s mother fall onto the floor bleeding which was why he shot George because he was worried that George had killed his mother. Charlie was then tried as an adult for capital murder which was later switched to an act of self defence with Bryan Stevenson’s help which resulted in Juvenile detention and a release before he turned 18. Luckily, Charlie’s mother slowly recovered and he was taken care of by a Mr. and Mrs. Jennings, a kind white older couple whose grandchild passed away due to suicide. This was considered a violation because without Bryan’s help, Charlie would have been in an adult prison at 14 years old for an act of self defence. George also violated Charlie’s mom’s rights because he sexually abused her and nearly killed her. Charlie was a black boy which was likely why the court was so strict on him which is another violation in itself as condemning him as initially condemning him as an adult partially because he was black which is racism. Instances of drug abuse, and gang violence, poverty and mental illness occur in a young 14 year old Latino boy named Antonio Nuñez’s case where he grew up in a poor neighborhood full of gang violence and drug abuse and watched his older brother José who was 14 at the time die by gunshots right in front of him when he was 13 which resulted in PTSD. Antonio ended up getting put in adult prison for shooting at an officer even though the bullets didn’t even hit. Finally, an example of rape is a 14 year old girl named Trina who was raped by her father and a prison guard after being unfairly charged with second-degree murder when it was a mistake. All of these violations should have never happened and would have never happened had the justice system been more just back when those accidental crimes were committed.</span></p></div>
