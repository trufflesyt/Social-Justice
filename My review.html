    <div id="paragraph"><p><span class="highlight">I give Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson four stars because I enjoyed reading about someone who shares the same passion for justice as me and liked seeing how he stood up for those who needed it most. The only thing that I didn’t like about the book is that not all of the prisoners he helped were able to avoid execution. Bryan Stevenson has inspired me even further to become a lawyer because in his book, he showed me how much of a difference it can make. I also enjoyed the murder mystery aspect of some of the cases, Walter Williams’ in particular I felt like I was in the book solving the crime alongside Bryan which I found very interesting. My reason for wanting to be a lawyer is very similar to Bryan's as it is to help the less fortunate people in the world because I believe that everyone deserves to be treated as equals rather than being divided into separate classes depending on how much or how little they have.</span></p></div>
