    <div id="paragraph"><p><span class="highlight">Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson is a story about a lawyer's experiences with wrongly accused prisoners on death row. The majority of the prisoners he helps are either poor or black as the cases took place during the American Civil Rights movement era during which black people were still viewed as slaves resulting in lyching and a large number of wrong accusations. Bryan Stevenson along with his friend Eva Ansley open a non-profit law office to help all of these wrongly condemned people and give people the justice they deserve, exploring a variety of Civil Rights movements and discriminatory laws in the process. </span></p>

    <h2><span class="highlight">How does it align with the Social Justice 12 curriculum?</span></h2>
    <p><span class="highlight">This book fits with the Social Justice 12 curriculum as it talks about the American Civil Rights movement which is part of the Civil Rights unit in the course. In Walter McMillan’s case, the sheriff accused him of a murder he didn’t commit just because he was poor and black and they needed to accuse someone to assure the townspeople. This case relates to the curriculum because it demonstrates the issues faced by black people in the 1900s and early 2000s and is an example of one of the many wrongly accused black prisoners on death row. Just Mercy talks about various Civil rights movements such as Plessy v. Ferguson and Brown v. board of education which were both crucial steps for blacks obtaining their rights in a segregated and prejudiced America. The book also deals with rape and sexual abuse which are both covered in the Human Rights unit. Trina was a young 14 year old girl with a dad who was a former boxer that sexually abused and raped her. In August 1976 she was caught breaking into a house with her 16 year old friend Francis Newscome to hang out with some boys whose mother prohibited them from playing with her. When Trina tried using a candle for light, it ended up setting fire to the building and killing the boys that lived there resulting in Trina getting charged as an adult for second-degree murder. This is an example of a violation of child rights as not only was Trina tried as an adult when she was 14 but her dad was also a violent man who sexually abused and raped her. In short, Just Mercy by Bryan Stevenson fits the Social Justice 12 curriculum because it deals with issues that are part of both the Civil Rights and Human Rights units.</span></p></div>
